# Setup Checklist - Your Project's Pre-Flight Check

**Use this checklist when starting a NEW project with the WorkflowKitt template.**

This guide assumes you've never done this before. We'll check step-by-step that everything is ready before you start building.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Open Your Project Folder

1. Find the folder with your project name (the one you downloaded or copied from the template)
2. Open it so you can see all the files inside
3. You should see folders named: `00-planning`, `01-docs`, `02-design`, `03-code`, `04-assets`

**✋ Stop if:** You don't see these folders. You might be in the wrong folder or the template didn't copy correctly.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Customize Your CLAUDE.md File

This is the instruction manual that tells the AI about YOUR specific project.

**Find the file:** Look for `CLAUDE.md` in your main project folder (the one you just opened).

**What to change:**

1. **Project Name** (near the top)
   - Change `Project Name: [Your Project Name]` to your actual project name
   - Example: `Project Name: Recipe Finder App`

2. **One-Line Description**
   - Describe what your app does in one sentence
   - Example: `An app that helps home cooks find recipes based on ingredients they have`

3. **Target User**
   - Who will use your app?
   - Example: `Home cooks who want to reduce food waste`

4. **Tech Stack** (optional for now)
   - If you know what technologies you want to use, write them here
   - If you don't know yet, that's okay! The interrogation phase will help you figure this out

**✋ Stop if:** You can't find CLAUDE.md or you're not sure how to edit it. Ask the AI: "Help me customize my CLAUDE.md file."

## ✅ Step 3: Quick Structure Check

Make sure these folders exist in your project:

- [ ] `00-planning` - This is where planning documents live
- [ ] `01-docs` - This is where detailed documentation goes
- [ ] `02-design` - This is for design files and images
- [ ] `03-code` - This is where your actual code will be
- [ ] `04-assets` - This is for images, fonts, and other files your app needs

Make sure these files exist:

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` - The AI's instruction manual (you just customized this!)
- [ ] `progress.txt` - Your project diary (AI updates this automatically)
- [ ] `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md` - The main workflow guide

**✋ Stop if:** Any of these are missing. You might need to re-download the template.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Open Claude Code

This is the AI tool you'll work with.

1. Open Claude Code (the app or terminal version)
2. Tell it to work in your project folder
3. Say: "Read CLAUDE.md and progress.txt. I'm starting a new project called [YOUR PROJECT NAME]."

The AI should respond by acknowledging your project and asking if you're ready to begin.

**✋ Stop if:** Claude Code doesn't respond or seems confused. Make sure you're in the right folder.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Start the Interrogation Phase

Now you're ready to begin! The first step is always **interrogation** - where the AI asks you questions to understand exactly what you want to build.

**Say this to the AI:**

```
I'm ready to start the interrogation phase. Please read INTERROGATION_PROMPTS.md
and begin asking me questions about my project.
```

The AI will ask you 8-12 questions. Take your time answering them. The better your answers, the better your app will be.

---

## 🎯 How to Know You're Ready

You're ready to move forward when:

✅ Your CLAUDE.md file has your project name and description
✅ All folders and files are in place
✅ Claude Code is open and working in your project folder
✅ You've told the AI to start interrogation

## ⚠️ Common Setup Mistakes

### "I don't see any folders"
- You might be looking at the wrong folder. Make sure you're in the main project folder, not inside one of the subfolders.

### "CLAUDE.md looks empty or generic"
- That's okay if this is a brand new project! Just add your project name and description at the top. The AI will help fill in the rest.

### "Claude Code says it can't find files"
- Make sure you opened Claude Code IN your project folder (not your Desktop or Documents folder).

### "I don't know what to put in CLAUDE.md yet"
- Just add your project name and a rough description. The interrogation phase will help you figure out the rest!

## 📖 What Happens Next?

After setup, you'll move through these phases:

1. **Interrogation** - AI asks questions (30-60 minutes)
2. **Documentation** - AI creates detailed docs (AI does most of this)
3. **Design** - You describe how it should look (30-60 minutes)
4. **Build** - AI writes the code (AI does most of this)
5. **Polish** - You test and give feedback (you lead this)
6. **Ship** - Make it live! (you lead this)

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you get stuck at any point:

1. Ask the AI directly: "I'm stuck at [specific step]. Can you help?"
2. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common problems
3. Read `WORKFLOW_QUICKSTART.md` for an overview of the whole process

You've got this! 🚀
