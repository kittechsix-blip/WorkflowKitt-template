## Session Log
===============================================================================

### February 7, 2026 - Session 4
---------------------------
CONTEXT:
- Complete rebuild specification created
- Ready for focused implementation session
- All design decisions finalized

COMPLETED:
- ✅ Created comprehensive REBUILD_SPEC.md (600+ lines)
- ✅ Designed purple color scheme (high contrast, pearl white bg)

- ✅ Designed 4-phase structure (15 steps total)
- ✅ Designed EditablePrompt component (inline field editing)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md template with complete workflow
- ✅ Specified bonus features placement (after phases)
- ✅ Created detailed implementation plan

KEY DECISIONS:
- Pearl white background (#FEFDFB) with dark purple text (#1A0F2E) - HIGH CONTRAST
- Purple accents from Kittech logo (#7B5FCC)
- 4 phases: Planning (4), Build (5), Polish (4), Ship (2) = 15 steps total
- Inline editable prompts with fill-in-the-blank fields
- Bonus features kept but moved after core workflow
- Complete CLAUDE.md with Plan Mode, AskUserQuestion, one-task-at-a-time workflow

FILES CREATED:
- /REBUILD_SPEC.md (complete implementation specification)
- /scratchpad/PURPLE_COLOR_SCHEME_V2.js
- /scratchpad/EDITABLE_PROMPT_COMPONENT.jsx
- /scratchpad/NEW_GUIDE_STRUCTURE.md
- /scratchpad/NEW_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md

NEXT SESSION START HERE:
"Build Workflow Kitt V2 from REBUILD_SPEC.md located at:
/Users/kittechsix/Desktop/AI Projects/WorkflowKitt-template/REBUILD_SPEC.md

Create Workflow-Kitt-V2.html following the spec exactly."

---------------------------

### February 7, 2026 - Session 3
---------------------------
CONTEXT:
- Working on template enhancements (Wave 1 of 3)
- Implementing plan from previous planning session
- Focus: Foundation & testing infrastructure

COMPLETED:
- ✅ Created SETUP_CHECKLIST.md in 00-planning/
- ✅ Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md in root
- ✅ Enhanced progress.txt template structure
- ✅ Comprehensive code review of Workflow Kitt.html
- ✅ Dogfooded SETUP_CHECKLIST → validated guide project structure
- ✅ Dogfooded enhanced progress.txt → Session 3 uses new format
- ✅ Created WAVE1_CODE_REVIEW.md with full analysis

IN PROGRESS:
- Awaiting browser testing (user will perform)

BLOCKED:
- None

KEY DECISIONS:
- Beginner-first language in all new docs (assume zero technical knowledge)
- Concrete examples over abstract explanations
- Checklists over prose for actionability
- Code review before browser testing validates implementation
- Guide has 21 steps (not 20) - added "Create Learning Story" in Phase 6

KEY FINDINGS FROM CODE REVIEW:
- All 6 phases present with proper structure ✅
- All core features implemented correctly ✅
- Comprehensive error handling throughout ✅
- localStorage gracefully degrades ✅
- Mobile optimizations present ✅
- Accessibility features included ✅
- 9 bonus features beyond original spec (search, favorites, projects library, etc.)
- No critical bugs found in code review ✅
- Ready for browser testing ⏳

FILES MODIFIED:
- /00-planning/SETUP_CHECKLIST.md (created)
- /TROUBLESHOOTING.md (created)
- /progress.txt (enhanced template structure + Wave 1 update)

WAVE 1 STATUS:
✅ All 3 deliverables complete
✅ Dogfooding successful
✅ Code review complete
⏳ Browser testing pending (requires user)
⏳ Mobile testing pending (requires user)

NEXT SESSION START HERE:
1. User: Open "Workflow Kitt.html" in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
2. User: Follow testing checklist in WAVE1_CODE_REVIEW.md
3. User: Document any bugs or issues found
4. AI: Fix any critical issues discovered
5. AI: Proceed to Wave 2 (Quality & Handoff documents)
